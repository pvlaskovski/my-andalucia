  - Just a stone’s throw way from Cadiz, the capital of the southern province of Spain, at the Atlantic coast is situated one of the favorite beach resorts for many local tourists Conil de la frontera. Even though it’s a fisherman village with only 22000 inhabitants it has a lot to offer. The combination of traditional Andalusian  restaurants, tiny streets with small white-painted houses, stalls with handmade crafts and vast beaches with golden sand makes Conil so unique and charming.
  - The first thing to do once you get to Conil is to make your way to a typical Spanish cafeteria and have your breakfast and coffee there. Most probably you will be offered fresh orange juice and a toast with tomato paste and olive oil, which is the most popular breakfast in Spain.
  - Once you are done with your breakfast, head to the one of the beaches there. You will notice that the coastline is huge. The absence of buildings at the coast, the golden sand and the crystal clear water will give you the impression that you at on a wild and untouched beach. Later in the afternoon you will witness water tide which occurs there on a daily basis. Get your camera prepared to capture the most magical moment of the day when the sun drowns into the water.
